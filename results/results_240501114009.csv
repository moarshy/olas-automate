Uncertainty has been cast over export financing and insurance for other in- state firms as well, forcing some to consider alternative options. The bank, known as EX-IM, is not processing new applications or engaging in new business since its charter expired at midnight June 30. Its services include loans to foreign companies buying American exports, export-credit insurance against foreign companies' failure to pay, and loan guarantees for U.S. banks providing working capital to exporters to meet foreign orders. The bank continues to service existing loans and policies in place before July 1, so some Connecticut companies aren't feeling a pinch yet. But the bank's freeze on new business has complicated a couple multimillion- dollar deals for Wallingford-based APS Technology Inc., which manufactures measurement while drilling (MWD) technology that communicates to crude oil exploration companies exactly what direction they are drilling in and what kind of substances are around the drilling bits. The deals — one involving a former Soviet country, another with a large national oil company in the Americas — had received preliminary approval for EX-IM financing, said Paul Seaton, vice president of marketing. The export sales could be prejudiced by the lack of EX-IM support, he said, noting that the financing environment now is more challenging with the oil industry downturn. “In the good days, when we were flying high, we could finance a smaller purchase,” Seaton said. “But we'd rather be doing that at the moment with the help of EX-IM.” That leaves APS trying to figure out some other methodology for the foreign sales. If APS can successfully introduce its equipment to the large national oil company, the potential for futureARTICLE 1, URL: http://breakingdefense.com/2015/09/theyre-back-congress-likely-to-pass-short-term-budget-deal/, CONTENT: Congress comes back after Labor Day and its 535 lawmakers will face one of the most convoluted legislative tangles in recent memory. While there is no clear endgame yet, all parties know what must be done and — roughly — by what time. Up first is the resolution of disapproval for the administration’s Iranian nuclear deal, which must be considered by September 17. Rumors are that House leaders intend to move the resolution concurrently with the defense policy bill (NDAA), which is essentially complete after House and Senate Armed Services Committee conference negotiations this summer. Mackenzie Eaglen, defense analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. Next up after these two major items will come a spending bill of some kind so the federal government does not shut down. A one-month (maybe longer) Continuing Resolution (CR) to prevent a government shutdown on October 1 is the most likely path. Once a short-term CR is — presumably — out of the way, the budget endgame will begin to take shape. There will most likely be a deal to lift the Budget Control Act caps, but the final spending bill will not be in the model of Ryan-Murray, nor will it led by Budget Committees leadership. This new omnibus appropriations deal will actually lift defense and non-defense discretionary caps higher than they would have risen otherwise—essentially meeting the President’s requested levels and the Republican-passed budget for defense. The main challenges to a bipartisan budget deal will be the necessity of addressing both the expiration of the highway spending reauthorization — November 1 — and the non-negotiable debt ceiling increase — sometime between mid-November and early December. Potent political issues include immigration, Export-Import Bank reauthorization and efforts to defund Planned Parenthood also threaten to intrude, particularly as Republican presidential candidates look to make an impressionARTICLE 2, URL: http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/08/the-speaker-chase-whos-next/, CONTENT: The sudden decision Thursday by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) to withdraw from the speaker’s race thrust congressional Republicans into chaos and left the contest wide open, with a crowd of lesser-known players jockeying for power and rank-and-file members fretting that the political unrest on the hard right that drove McCarthy and House Speaker John A. Boehner away from the position has left the party unmanageable in the lower chamber. Conservatives seized the moment as McCarthy made his exodus, celebrating the departure of one of the GOP’s moderates and fastest-rising stars — and pledging to push for one of their own, a hard-liner on fiscal and social issues, to step forward in the coming weeks before the leadership elections are rescheduled. McCarthy’s associates, many hailing from mainstream Republican districts, urged caution and began efforts to draft another centrist Republican to succeed Boehner (Ohio). Boehner personally asked House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to run for speaker over two long phone conversations, according to two sources familiar with the exchanges. Boehner has told Ryan that he is the only person who can unite the House GOP at a time of turmoil. “It is total confusion — a banana republic,” said Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), a Boehner ally, as he recounted seeing a handful of House Republicans weeping Thursday over the downfall of McCarthy and the broader discord. “Any plan, anything you anticipate, who knows what’ll happen. People are crying. They don’t have any idea how this will unfold at all.” The scene at the Capitol yielded more questions than answers by the hour Thursday afternoon, with an array of influential figures such as Ryan still reluctant to take McCarthy’s place as the consensus candidate of the party’s establishment and those averse to firebrands.

He was also the second-ranked member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from 2012 to 2022. Li was a major part of the ""fifth generation of Chinese leadership"" along with Xi Jinping, the CCP general secretary. Born in Hefei, Anhui province, in 1955, Li initially rose through the ranks of Chinese politics through his involvement in the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC), serving as its first secretary from 1993 to 1998. From 1998 to 2004, Li served as the governor of Henan and the province's party secretary. From 2004 to 2007 he served as the party secretary of Liaoning, the top political office in the province. From 2008 to 2013, Li served as the first-ranked vice premier under then-premier Wen Jiabao, overseeing a broad portfolio which included economic development, price controls, finance, climate change, and macroeconomic management. Initially seen as a candidate for becoming the paramount leader, Li instead assumed the post of premier in 2013, and facilitated the Chinese government's shifting of priorities from export-led growth to a greater focus on internal consumption. During his term Li headed the State Council and was one of the leading figures behind China's Financial and Economic Affairs, Foreign Affairs, National Security and Deepening Reforms. Additionally, Li and his cabinet initiated the Made in China 2025 strategic plan in May 2015. Given his Youth League experience, Li was generally considered a political ally of former leader Hu Jintao and a member of the Tuanpai faction.

It lasted from August 13, 1937, to November 26, 1937, and was one of the largest and bloodiest battles of the entire war, and even regarded by some historians as the first battle of World War II. After over three months of extensive fighting on land, in the air and at sea, the battle concluded with a victory for Japan. Both sides accused each other of using chemical weapons during the battle, both without evidence.Since the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 followed by the Japanese attack of Shanghai in 1932, there had been ongoing armed conflicts between China and Japan without an official declaration of war. These conflicts finally escalated in July 1937, when the Marco Polo Bridge Incident triggered the full advance from Japan. Dogged Chinese resistance at Shanghai was aimed at stalling Japanese advance, giving much needed time for the Chinese government to move vital industries to the interior, while at the same time attempting to bring sympathetic Western powers to China's side. During the fierce three-month battle, Chinese and Japanese troops fought in downtown Shanghai, in the outlying towns, and on the beaches of the Yangtze River and Hangzhou Bay, where the Japanese had made amphibious landings. Chinese forces were equipped primarily with small-caliber weapons against much greater Japanese air, naval, and armor power. In the end, Shanghai fell, and China lost a significant portion of its best troops, while failing to elicit any international intervention. However, the resistance of Chinese forces over three months of battle shocked the Japanese,```OUTPUT_FORMAT* Your output response must be only a single JSON object to be parsed by Python's ""json.loads()"".* The JSON must contain four fields: ""p_yes"", ""p_no"", ""confidence"", and ""info_utility"".* Each item in the JSON must have a value between 0 and 1.   - ""p_yes"": Estimated probability that the event in the ""USER_PROMPT"" occurs.   - ""p_no"": Estimated probability that the event in the ""USER_PROMPT"" does not occur.   - ""confidence"": A value between 0 and 1 indicating the confidence in the prediction. 0 indicates lowest     confidence value; 1 maximum confidence value.   - ""info_utility"": Utility of the information provided in ""ADDITIONAL_INFORMATION"" to help you make the prediction.     0 indicates lowest utility; 1 maximum utility.* The sum of ""p_yes"" and ""p_no"" must equal 1.* Output only the JSON object.

Western critics of the negotiations, along with Iranian dissidents, have lamented that the US made serious concessions to the Iranian regime during those talks, ultimately allowing Iran to block foreign access to its military sites and severely delay access to other sites, while still retaining a large portion of its functional nuclear infrastructure. But dissidents affiliated with the National Council of Resistance of Iran have also repeatedly emphasized that any limits whatsoever to Iran’s progress toward nuclear weapons is regarded by regime officials as a damaging concession. Khamenei’s latest remarks appear to lend credence to this. An outright ban on future negotiations with the US also promises to damage apparent Western optimism about broad-based rapprochement. These hopes had already been complicated by Khamenei’s previous, slightly more measured statements, as well as by similarly aggressive commentary from President Hassan Rouhani, who has nonetheless used some public statements to suggest moderate improvements in relations between the two countries. Last week, Rouhani appeared to straddle both sides of his inconsistent statements about the West when he suggested that the US might be able to negotiate for the release of three Americans held prisoner in Iran, but insisted that the US first release 19 Iranian citizens imprisoned in the US for sanctions violations. Although such an offer arguably favors Iran from the very outset, Khamenei’s superior authority means that these negotiations are no longer a possibility in light of the supreme leader’s edict.

A fifth man – described as a recently detained student named Matthew Trevithick – was separately released, U.S. officials said. The announcement comes on a day when the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, announced Iran is in compliance with a July deal to restrict its nuclear program. As a result, at least some international economic sanctions against Iran were lifted. As part of the deal, Iran agreed to release of Rezaian, Hekmati, Abedini and a fourth detainee identified by U.S. officials as Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari in exchange for clemency for seven Iranians indicted or imprisoned in the United States for sanctions violations, the officials confirmed. Six of the seven are dual citizens. The deal comes after more than a year of secret negotiations, the officials said. The nuclear agreement “accelerated” the prisoner swap, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said. The secret talks were led by Brett McGurk, the U.S. special envoy tapped by President Barack Obama to coordinate the global fight against the ISIS terrorist group, senior U.S. administration officials said.

In fact, the hardliners that control the judiciary and other institutions have been working hard to undercut the image of moderation that President Hassan Rouhani has tried to project since his election in 2013. Iran's foreign ministry campaigned hard against a Canadian-sponsored UN resolution on human rights. Last Friday, a General Assembly committee voted 76 in favor and 35 against with 68 countries abstaining. (In contrast Saudi Arabia's resolution on Syrian human rights violations was adopted by 115 votes in favor, 5 against and 51 abstentions.). The full Assembly will vote on the resolutions with the results nearly the same as in the committee, which includes all UN members. Although the resolution is non-binding, it highlights Tehran's human rights excesses to the world. The measure calls upon the Iranian government to stop its plethora of executions, stoning, flogging and other forms of torture. It says Iran should stop discrimination against women and minorities and stop arresting journalists and human rights defenders, among others. In response, Iran's deputy UN ambassador told the committee that the draft resolution was a ""selective and politicized distortion of facts."" He said the nuclear deal opened ""a new horizon for cooperation, based on dialogue, understanding, mutual respect and promotion of shared values of human rights, peace and security.""

Abstract Our goal is to reveal temporal variations in videos that are difﬁ- cult or impossible to see with the naked eye and display them in an indicative manner. Our method, which we call Eulerian Video Magniﬁcation, takes a standard video sequence as input, and ap- plies spatial decomposition, followed by temporal ﬁltering to the frames. The resulting signal is then ampliﬁed to reveal hidden in- formation. Using our method, we are able to visualize the ﬂow of blood as it ﬁlls the face and also to amplify and reveal small motions. Our technique can run in real time to show phenomena occurring at temporal frequencies selected by the user.

Although the Kwangmyongsong-3 satellite failed to orient itself properly and never beamed signals to earth-based stations as designed, Pyongyang nonetheless heralded the launch as an epic national achievement. The December launch, like those that preceded it, was promptly denounced by the international community. On January 22, after a month of intense negotiation, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 2087, which condemned North Korea’s use of ballistic missile technology in violation of Resolutions 1718 and 1874.[1] On February 12, in the wake of UN efforts to denounce the satellite launch, North Korea tested a nuclear weapon. Although international anger over Pyongyang’s launch using the Unha-3 rocket is understandable, efforts to condemn and punish North Korea for it might not be properly placed. Policymakers around the world face an important choice. They can impose further demands on an already heavily sanctioned country for exploring outer space, albeit using missile technologies. Alternatively, they can scale back their collective reaction to North Korean provocations that do not pose an immediate or significant threat and instead preserve their punitive responses for those activities that are most threatening, such as the February 12 nuclear test or future flight tests of long-range ballistic missiles. The history of ballistic missile development in other countries, which shows that space launches do not and cannot play a decisive role in the creation of long-range missiles, suggests the latter. Background In a 1993 speech to the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea, Kim Il Sung, North Korea’s leader from his founding of the country in 1948 until his death in 1994, called for North Korea to join the exclusiveARTICLE 2, URL: http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/08/how-does-pyongyang-prepare-for-a-rocket-launch-sohae-icbm-missile-satellite/, CONTENT: Speculation is mounting over whether North Korea will conduct another long- range rocket launch by Oct. 10, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Korean Workers Party. In late September, Pyongyang forcefully asserted its right to “peaceful space exploration,” and stated that the world “will clearly see a series of satellites …. soaring into the sky.” And in early October, North Korea’s ambassador to the United Kingdom, Hyon Hak Bong, told the British think-tank Chatham House that “we will go ahead” with a launch (though he didn’t elaborate about the details). Such a launch could contribute to North Korea’s development of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) — a missile that could carry a weapon from North Korea’s nuclear stockpile, and that might be able to strike the United States. It would also violate United Nations sanctions. If North Korea were to launch a rocket in October, it would likely do so from the Sohae Satellite Launching Station (pictured above), located in the country’s remote northwest, near the Chinese border. This installation is North Korea’s only modern space launch facility, and the site of its two 2012 launches: Their April 2012 launch failed, but the December launch that same year appeared to have been the first and only successful effort by Pyongyang to place a satellite in orbit. 38 North, a website that publishes analysis by experts who have experience working in North Korea or with North Koreans, began observing Sohae through commercial satellite photography prior to the April 2012 launch. The photos below show a gradual but extensive modernization of Sohae, from August 2013 to late September 2015, highlighting Pyongyang’s determination to pursue a space launch program with bigger and better rockets — and to lay “a firm foundation for dynamically pushing ahead with the nation’s development of```OUTPUT_FORMAT* Your output response must be only a single JSON object to be parsed by Python's ""json.loads()"".* The JSON must contain four fields: ""p_yes"", ""p_no"", ""confidence"", and ""info_utility"".* Each item in the JSON must have a value between 0 and 1.   - ""p_yes"": Estimated probability that the event in the ""USER_PROMPT"" occurs.   - ""p_no"": Estimated probability that the event in the ""USER_PROMPT"" does not occur.   - ""confidence"": A value between 0 and 1 indicating the confidence in the prediction. 0 indicates lowest     confidence value; 1 maximum confidence value.   - ""info_utility"": Utility of the information provided in ""ADDITIONAL_INFORMATION"" to help you make the prediction.     0 indicates lowest utility; 1 maximum utility.* The sum of ""p_yes"" and ""p_no"" must equal 1.* Output only the JSON object.

Data this detailed hasn’t been published by the BCV in over a year, and it makes for grim reading. The Bad News Few Venezuelans would be surprised to hear the economy isn’t doing well, but the new figures released by the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) on January 15 still felt like a punch in the gut. Annual inflation hit 141.5 percent in 2015 – double the 2014 rate, and easily the worst in the world. High inflation is nothing unusual in Venezuela. Yet since 1999, Chavismo has done a relatively reasonable job of keeping inflation well below crisis levels. However, the new figures also show Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has nosedived, sinking 7.1 percent by third quarter 2015. Growth isn’t everything, especially in an economy aiming to transition away from capitalism. Yet these numbers are extreme. Moreover, the devil is in the details. In its breakdown by sector, the Central Bank of Venezuela’s (BCV) report indicated food costs are among the biggest drivers of inflation. Venezuelan consumers saw the cost of food lurch upwards by 55.7 percent in the third quarter. Overall, food costs rose a whopping 254.3 percent in 2015 – a figure that easily surpasses wage increases by any measure. Increases of basic food costs disproportionately impact the poor, who typically spend a larger chunk of their income on necessities like staple foods. However, the BCV’s numbers also show the state apparatus as a whole is also bearing a heavy load. One of the most telling figures was to be found in the bank’s current account data, which showed a US$782 million trade deficit for the 2015 third quarter. This is particularlyARTICLE 2, URL: http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/02/graphics-political-and-economic-guide-venezuela, CONTENT: OF ALL the unflattering words used to describe the state of the country he governs, ""disaster"" is the one Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, dislikes the most. Perhaps that is because it is so apt. Under his watch, the nation has entered a steep decline. Mr Maduro has restricted the publication of official economic figures. Those that have been divulged confirm that 2015 was a very bad year. And 2016 is going to be worse. A global oil boom, which provided Hugo Chávez, Mr Maduro's populist predecessor, money to lavish on Venezuela's once neglected poor, is over. Mr Maduro has failed to persuade voters that he is a worthy heir. In a parliamentary election on December 6th 2015 the opposition Democratic Unity alliance (MUD) won two-thirds of the seats, the first time it has won a national election since Chávez came to power in 1999. Mr Maduro’s approval rating is not much above 20%. The new National Assembly is now engaged in a power struggle with the regime. Venezuela's Supreme Court, which can be counted on to side with the government, has ruled that three opposition MPs cannot be sworn in, depriving the MUD of its ""supermajority"". The price of oil, which provides 95% of Venezuela’s foreign-exchange earnings, has long dictated the popularity of its leaders. The government's income from oil in the year to November 2015 was two-thirds lower than during the same period the year before. The oil price has fallen further since then. With less money coming in and demand for imports still strong, the value of Venezuela's foreign-exchange reserves has dropped alarmingly. A fall during 2015 in the price of gold, of which Venezuela has substantial holdings, has contributed to the decline in reserves. The current oil slump would be painful, whoever was in power.

At September's close, Brent settled at $47.2/bbl while WTI reached $45.1/bbl. Both crudes were still down near six-and-a-half-year lows, however, depressed by continued worries about economic growth in emerging markets, particularly China's, and by the persistence of the crude oil supply glut. The US Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady was partly an implicit acknowledgment of the former, while the supply overhang dynamic was further evident in the rise to record levels of OECD commercial oil stocks and continued price discounting by regional oil producers Kuwait and Iran. The current discount of Kuwaiti export crude (KEC) against Saudi Arabia's benchmark Arab Light for Asian customers is the largest in 10 years as efforts intensify even among OPEC members to retain market share. Meanwhile, in the futures markets, the price for long-dated crude oil continues to trade higher than spot crude (i.e. crude for immediate delivery). (Chart 2.) The differential between the two prices in the so-called contango curve has narrowed, however, indicating that the appetite for storage for speculative purposes may be waning. As of September 30, according to the futures market, the price of Brent crude is expected to increase to $55.2/bbl by December 2016 and to $58.6/bbl by December 2017. Crude supply glut should ease in 2016 as oil demand rebounds and oil supply begins to be negatively affected by low oil prices The expectation that oil prices will rebound going into 2016 and beyond is based on a predicted unwinding of the demand/supply mismatch.

Stung by Russia's success in supplanting it in the giant Chinese market, Riyadh has embarked on a charm offensive in Europe, cutting its prices for December by more than it has in any other region to their lowest since 2009 during the financial crisis. Saudi Arabian barrels rarely venture north of the Mediterranean, into the home turf for Russian, African and North Sea crudes. As a result, the kingdom's success in luring away buyers of rival Russian Urals crude in Poland and Sweden is having an outsized knock-on impact on the market for a wide range of other crudes in the region. Refiners averted a price drop from a similar build up of surplus oil in spring, snapping up cheaper crude to feed a surge in gasoline demand. But this time there is a glut of refined fuel too. The crude surplus is matched by an overhang in oil products which means refineries will not be able to come to the rescue by absorbing the extra.

Media outlets are highlighting the rise of anti-vaccination sentiments. Scientists are expressing their dismay at people who reject sound medical advice and put their families and communities in harm’s way. Measles was considered eliminated in the United States in 2000. But if the first month of 2015 is any indication, this year will easily beat the record number of measles cases recorded in 2014. The narrative during this outbreak, or any measles outbreak really, is that measles is a highly transmissible disease. So transmissible in fact that 90-95% of people must be vaccinated in order to protect the entire population, or achieve what is called herd immunity. That is partly true. Measles is highly transmissible, not least because people can be contagious days before symptoms develop. But there are three problems with this line of reasoning about vaccination rates. First, the numbers are based on calculations that assume a world of random mixing. Second, the vaccination coverage is not a perfect measure of immunity in the population. Third, and most problematic in my view, it gives people a seemingly scientific justification for not getting vaccinated – after all, if not everyone needs to get vaccinated in order to attain herd immunity, can it really be so bad if I opt out of it? > What does it take to achieve herd immunity? Zebras by Andrzej > Kubik/Shutterstock What Exactly Is Herd Immunity? Let’s look at the concept of herd immunity first. The basic idea is that a group (the “herd”) can avoid exposure to a disease by ensuring that enough people are immune so that no sustained chains of transmission can be established.

Burns, PhD4; Arshad Quddus, MD3 (Author affiliations at end of text) In 1988, the World Health Assembly of the World Health Organization (WHO) resolved to eradicate polio worldwide (1). Wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission has been interrupted in all but three countries (Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan). No WPV type 2 cases have been detected worldwide since 1999, and the last WPV type 3 case was detected in Nigeria in November 2012; since 2012, only WPV type 1 has been detected (2). Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), usually type 2, continues to cause cases of paralytic polio in communities with low population immunity (3). In 2012, the World Health Assembly declared global polio eradication ""a programmatic emergency for global public health"" (1), and in 2014, WHO declared the international spread of WPV to previously polio-free countries to be ""a public health emergency of international concern"" (4). This report summarizes global progress toward polio eradication during 2014–2015 and updates previous reports (5). In 2014, a total of 359 WPV cases were reported in nine countries worldwide (6). Although reported WPV cases increased in Pakistan and Afghanistan, cases in Nigeria decreased substantially in 2014, and encouraging progress toward global WPV transmission interruption has occurred. Overcoming ongoing challenges to interruption of WPV transmission globally will require sustained programmatic enhancements, including improving the quality of supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) to interrupt transmission in Afghanistan and Pakistan and to prevent WPV exportation to polio-free countries. ### Routine Poliovirus Vaccination Coverage Estimated coverage in 2013 (the latest year for which complete data are available) among infants aged <1 year with 3 doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV3) delivered throughARTICLE 2, URL: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.02751v2.pdf, CONTENT: arXiv:1504.02751v2 [q-bio.PE] 10 Jul 2015Has wild poliovirus been eliminated from Nigeria?

At the time of writing, the most recent case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in Nigeria occurred in July 2 014, and WPV1 has not been seen in Africa since a case in Somalia in August 2014. No ca ses associated with circulating vaccine-derived type 2 poliovirus (cVDPV2) have bee n detected in Nigeria since November 2014. Has WPV1 been eliminated from Africa? Has WPV 3 been eradicated globally? Has Nigeria interrupted cVDPV2 transmission? T hese questions are difficult because polio surveillance is based on paralysis and paralysis o nly occurs in a small fraction of infections. This report provides estimates for the probabilities of poliovirus elimin ation in Nigeria given available data as of March 31, 2015. It is based on a model of dis ease transmission that is built from historical polio incidence rates and is designed to rep resent the uncertainties in transmission dynamics and poliovirus detection that are fundamental to interpreting long time periods without cases. The model estimates that, as of March 31, 2015, the probability of WPV1 elimination in Nigeria is 84%, and that if WPV1 has not been eliminated, a new case will be detected with 99% probability by the end of 2015. The probability of WPV3 eliminat ion (and thus 1/24global eradication) is >99%. However, it is unlikely that the ongoing transmission of cVDPV2 has been interrupted; the probability of cVDPV2 elimination r ises to 83% if no new```OUTPUT_FORMAT* Your output response must be only a single JSON object to be parsed by Python's ""json.loads()"".* The JSON must contain four fields: ""p_yes"", ""p_no"", ""confidence"", and ""info_utility"".* Each item in the JSON must have a value between 0 and 1.   - ""p_yes"": Estimated probability that the event in the ""USER_PROMPT"" occurs.   - ""p_no"": Estimated probability that the event in the ""USER_PROMPT"" does not occur.   - ""confidence"": A value between 0 and 1 indicating the confidence in the prediction. 0 indicates lowest     confidence value; 1 maximum confidence value.   - ""info_utility"": Utility of the information provided in ""ADDITIONAL_INFORMATION"" to help you make the prediction.     0 indicates lowest utility; 1 maximum utility.* The sum of ""p_yes"" and ""p_no"" must equal 1.* Output only the JSON object.

Unfortunately, not so many of those who use the quote have actually read The Seven Pillars of Wisdom in all of its sometimes mind-numbing ""Oh aren't these rocks and the shadows of the desert beautiful"" glory. Even fewer realize that the quote is actually from a collection tidbits of advice Lawrence penned during the war in a British publication known as The Arab Bulletin. This particular quote was number fifteen (of twenty-seven) pieces of wisdom published under his byline on 20 August 1917. The salient points regarding the relevance of the citations are actually twofold. This is an issue is because, especially when quoting Lawrence, the context is important. Today we are confronted with a unique set of problems. The regionalARTICLE 1, URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazira_Canton, CONTENT: The Jazira Region, formerly Jazira Canton, (Kurdish: Herêma Cizîrê, Arabic: إقليم الجزيرة, Syriac: ܦܢܝܬܐ ܕܓܙܪܬܐ, romanized: Ponyotho d'Gozarto), is the largest of the three original regions of the de facto Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES). As part of the ongoing Rojava conflict, its democratic autonomy was officially declared on 21 January 2014. The region is in the Al-Hasakah Governorate (formerly known as the Al-Jazira Province) of Syria. According to the AANES constitution, the city of Qamishli is the administrative center of Jazira Region. However, as parts of Qamishli remain under the control of Syrian government forces, meetings of the autonomous region's administration take place in the nearby city of Amuda.The region has two subordinate cantons, the Hasakah canton consisting of the al-Hasakah area (with the Al-Shaddadi, Al-Arisha and Al-Hawl districts subordinate to it), the Al-Darbasiyah area, and the Tell Tamer area, as well as the Qamishli canton consisting of the Qamishli area (with the Amûda, Tirbê Sipî, Tel Hemîs and Tel Berak districts subordinate to it) and the Derîk area (with the Girkê Legê, Tel Koçer and Çilaxa districts subordinate to it). Demographics Jazira Region's ethnic groups include Kurds, Arabs, Assyrians, Armenians and Yazidis. While Kurdish, Arabic and Syriac are official languages, all communities have the right to teach and be taught in their native language. Religions practiced in the region are Islam, Christianity and Yazidism. The majority of the Arabs and Kurds in the region are Sunni Muslim. Between 20 and 30% of the people of Al-Hasakeh governorate are Christians of various churches and denominations.Cities and towns with more than 10,000 inhabitants according to the 2004 Syrian census are Hasakah (188,160), Qamishli (184,231), Amuda (26,821), Al-Malikiyah (26,311), Al-Qahtaniyah (16,946), Al-Shaddadah (15,806), Al-Muabbada (15,759), Al-Sabaa wa Arbain (14,177) and Al-Manajir (12,156).

To join the EU, a state needs to fulfil economic and political conditions called the Copenhagen criteria (after the Copenhagen summit in June 1993), which require a stable democratic government that respects the rule of law, and its corresponding freedoms and institutions. According to the Maastricht Treaty, each current member state and the European Parliament must agree to any enlargement. The process of enlargement is sometimes referred to as European integration. This term is also used to refer to the intensification of co-operation between EU member states as national governments allow for the gradual harmonisation of national laws. The EU's predecessor, the European Economic Community, was founded with the Inner Six member states in 1958, when the Treaty of Rome came into force. Since then, the EU's membership has grown to twenty-seven, with the latest member state being Croatia, which joined in July 2013. The most recent territorial enlargement of the EU was the incorporation of Mayotte in 2014. Campione d'Italia joined the EU Customs Union in 2020. The most notable territorial reductions of the EU, and its predecessors, have been the exit of Algeria upon independence in 1962, the exit of Greenland in 1985, and the withdrawal of the United Kingdom in 2020. As of 2022, accession negotiations are under way with Albania (since 2020), Montenegro (since 2012), North Macedonia (since 2020), Serbia (since 2014) and Turkey (since 2005). Negotiations with Turkey are ongoing, but have effectively paused due to objections from the EU. These include accusations of human rights issues and unfair election practices.Bosnia and Herzegovina submitted an application for membership in 2016, as did Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova in the first few```OUTPUT_FORMAT* Your output response must be only a single JSON object to be parsed by Python's ""json.loads()"".* The JSON must contain four fields: ""p_yes"", ""p_no"", ""confidence"", and ""info_utility"".* Each item in the JSON must have a value between 0 and 1.   - ""p_yes"": Estimated probability that the event in the ""USER_PROMPT"" occurs.   - ""p_no"": Estimated probability that the event in the ""USER_PROMPT"" does not occur.   - ""confidence"": A value between 0 and 1 indicating the confidence in the prediction. 0 indicates lowest     confidence value; 1 maximum confidence value.   - ""info_utility"": Utility of the information provided in ""ADDITIONAL_INFORMATION"" to help you make the prediction.     0 indicates lowest utility; 1 maximum utility.* The sum of ""p_yes"" and ""p_no"" must equal 1.* Output only the JSON object.

State media quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying planes had deliberately targeted the site. But some later reports in Iran said missiles had struck only in the vicinity of the embassy. Residents and witnesses in Sanaa reported there was no damage to the main embassy building. Although the incident may turn out to be less serious than initially feared, the BBC's Arab Affairs Editor Sebastian Usher says the growing row between Saudi Arabia and Iran could derail peace efforts in Syria and Iraq, as well as in Yemen. ## More on Saudi-Iran tensions Image source, AP The Saudi-US-Iran triangle: How crisis reflects deeply fractured Middle East Great rivalry explained: Why don't Iran and Saudi Arabia get along?

The row began after Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia executed a Shia cleric, Nimr al- Nimr.

A number of Saudi allies have followed suit in taking diplomatic action against Iran. Meanwhile on Thursday Iran banned the import of all Saudi goods, according to a statement read on Iranian state TV. ## Analysis: BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner Ever since the Saudi-led air campaign began against Yemen's Houthi rebels last March, there was always a risk that the cold war between the region's two big rivals, Saudi Arabia and Iran, could ignite into something more serious.

Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told reporters in Riyadh that the Iranian ambassador to Saudi Arabia had been given 48 hours to leave the country, citing concerns that Tehran’s Shiite government was undermining the security of the mostly Sunni kingdom. Saudi diplomats had already departed Iran after angry mobs trashed and burned the Saudi Embassy in Tehran overnight Saturday, in retaliation for the execution of Sheik Nimr Baqr al-Nimr earlier in the day. The rift sets the region’s two biggest powerhouses on a collision course at a critical time for U.S. diplomacy aimed at bringing peace to the Middle East, and it raises the specter of worsening violence in countries where they back rival factions, such as Yemen and Syria. Despite their countless international feuds, it was the first time since a two-year rupture in 1988-1990 that diplomatic relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia had formally been severed, according to Abdullah al-Shamri, a Saudi analyst and former diplomat. Protests erupt after Saudi Arabia executes Shiite cleric Nimr Baqr al-Nimr The country’s announcement that it has killed 47 people has caused an uproar across the region. Saudi Arabia severed relations with Iran on Sunday amid the furor. Nimr was among 47 people put to death on the biggest single day of executions in Saudi Arabia since 1980. He was one of only four Shiite Muslims in the group and was by far the best known. Most of the others were Sunnis accused of carrying out a spate of attacks linked to the Sunni al-Qaeda organization over a decade ago.

After having been forced to exclude US traders in 2012, on 10 March 2013 Intrade suspended all trading, citing possible ""financial irregularities"". For a time after the suspension, the intrade.com website stated that they were working on a relaunch of the site, called ""Intrade 2.0"", but as of August 2014 it states that ""It appears very unlikely now that Intrade will resume trading services in the way it had operated previously"", and announced plans to close all accounts and refund monies by 31 December 2014. History Intrade was founded by Ron Bernstein and Sean McNamara, a New York futures and options floor trader in 1999. Intrade was later acquired by Tradesports in 2003. John Delaney, the VP of Finance at Intrade, was appointed as the CEO of Tradesports during the acquisition of Intrade by Tradesports. In 2004, Tradesports was re-organized into Trade Exchange Network Limited (who operated the websites Intrade.com, Tradesports.com, WallStreetSports.com, Prediction-X.com and other websites using the Intrade trading platform and technology). In 2007, Trade Exchange Network Limited was re-organized into three new corporate entities: Intrade the Prediction Market Limited (currently operating Intrade.com), Tradesports Ltd (previously operating Tradesports.com, which closed in 2008), and Prediction Exchange Services Limited, a technology company (which never initiated operations). Intrade's system utilises a prediction market trading exchange which allows members to take positions (trade 'contracts') on whether future events will or will not occur. An example event is a political election, which is almost always settled in a well-defined and verifiable manner. The contract might be ""Mitt Romney to win 2012 U.S. presidential election"".

While CETA will now be approved by the European Council and head towards the Parliament, its future looks bleak. And it gets worse for Brussels. Because Belgium’s regional parliaments have, in the process of hobbling CETA, driven a stake into the heart of European trade policy. No wonder Financial Times columnist Wolfgang Munchau hailed the so-called ‘breakthrough’ as “a huge victory for Belgium's Ceta opponents”. CETA (the Comprehensive Economic & Trade Agreement) is the sister deal of the better known TTIP trade deal between the US and EU. Just like its sibling, it is essentially not about reducing tariffs, but deregulation, liberalisation, and the handing of further powers over law-making to big business. Despite some fancy footwork by the EU to reform the hated “corporate court” system, which gives foreign investors their own special legal process to sue governments, that system is very much still in place in CETA. As such, this toxic trade deal has been subject to the same massive protest movement that greeted TTIP. Nearly 3.5 million Europeans said they didn’t want either deal, in a huge 12 month petition campaign. There are hundreds of TTIP and CETA-free local authorities across Europe. And finally, in the last few weeks, Wallonia and other Belgian regions froze the whole process temporarily by refusing to allow Belgium to sign the deal. ## Brexit Concerns Show all 26 ### Brexit Concerns #### Brexit will put British patients at 'back ofARTICLE 2, URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_Trade_and_Investment_Partnership, CONTENT: The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) was a proposed trade agreement between the European Union (EU) and the United States, with the aim of promoting trade and multilateral economic growth. According to Karel de Gucht, European Commissioner for Trade between 2010 and 2014, the TTIP would have been the largest bilateral trade initiative ever negotiated, not only because it would have involved the two largest economic areas in the world but also ""because of its potential global reach in setting an example for future partners and agreements"".Negotiations were halted by United States president Donald Trump, who then initiated a trade conflict with the EU. Trump and the EU declared a truce of sorts in July 2018, resuming talks that appeared similar to TTIP. On 15 April 2019, the negotiations were declared ""obsolete and no longer relevant"" by the European Commission.The reports on the past negotiations and the contents of the negotiated TTIP proposals are classified information, and can be accessed only by authorised persons. Multiple leaks of proposed TTIP contents into the public caused controversy.The European Commission claimed that the TTIP would have boosted the EU's economy by €120 billion, the US economy by €90 billion and the rest of the world by €100 billion. According to Anu Bradford, law professor at Columbia Law School, and Thomas J. Bollyky of the Council on Foreign Relations, TTIP aimed to ""liberalise one-third of global trade"" and could create millions of new jobs. A Guardian article by Dean Baker of the US thinktank Center for Economic and Policy Research argued that the economic benefits per household would be relatively small.
